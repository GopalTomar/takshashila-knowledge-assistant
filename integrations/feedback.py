"""
feedback.py — Append-only feedback log for the Takshashila Mattermost bot.

When a user taps 👍 / 👎 under an answer, the bot records a single structured,
secret-free line in ``data/logs/mattermost_feedback.jsonl``. Leadership can tail
or aggregate this file to see how helpful the assistant is over time.

Only non-sensitive fields are stored: a timestamp, the verdict, the (truncated)
question, the user-visible name/id Mattermost already exposes, and the channel.
No tokens, no document content, no embeddings.
