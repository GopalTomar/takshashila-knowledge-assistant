"""
help_text.py — Presentation for the bot's ``help`` / ``examples`` / landing cards.

Kept separate from ``command_parser`` (which only *parses*) and from
``formatting`` (which renders *answers*). These three functions return finished
Markdown strings the bot posts verbatim, so the copy lives in one place and can
evolve without touching parsing, routing or delivery.

Group examples are shown only when group messaging is enabled, so the help never
advertises a destination the deployment has turned off.
