"""
citations.py — Post-generation citation verification (anti-hallucination).

The LLM is told to answer only from the retrieved context and to cite inline
like [Source N]. This module double-checks that promise BEFORE the answer is
shown, so the displayed references exactly match where the answer came from:

  1. Parse the [Source N] markers the model actually used.
  2. Keep ONLY those sources (dropping retrieved-but-uncited chunks), and
     renumber the answer so [Source 1..M] line up with the shown list.
  3. Ground-check: measure token overlap between the answer text and the cited
     chunks. If the answer cites nothing verifiable AND overlaps the retrieved
     context too little, flag it as ungrounded so the pipeline can refuse
     instead of surfacing a possibly hallucinated answer.

Everything here is deterministic and dependency-free (no extra model calls).
